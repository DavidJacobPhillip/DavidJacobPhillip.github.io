        <p><b>What challenges or troubles did you have completing the assignment? How did you solve them?</b></p>
        <p>The biggest hurdle I had was figuring out how to use git to publish a website through either engr servers or github. The way I overcame this was by talking with a TA, and really understanding what I needed to do.</p>
        <p><b>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</b></p>
        <p>I had done a lot of work doing web-dev through some online courses, so I knew the DOM model fairly well. However, I did need a refresher on all the tags. Learning to use Github/Git was something I learned from this assignment however. </p>
        <p><b>What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use those resources?</b></p>
		<p>As aforementioned, I really took advantage of talking to a TA about the problems I was facing. For minor discrepencies, I would ask my fellow CS 290 friends for help on understanding concepts. </p>
