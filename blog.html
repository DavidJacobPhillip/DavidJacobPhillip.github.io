        <p><b>What challenges or troubles did you have completing the assignment? How did you solve them?</b></p>
        <p>The biggest hurdle I had was figuring out how to use git to publish a website through either engr servers or github. The way I overcame this was by talking with a TA, and really understanding what I needed to do.</p>
        <p><b>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</b></p>
        <p>I had done a lot of work doing web-dev through some online courses, so I knew the DOM model fairly well. However, I did need a refresher on all the tags. Learning to use Github/Git was something I learned from this assignment however. </p>
        <p><b>What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use those resources?</b></p>
		<p>As aforementioned, I really took advantage of talking to a TA about the problems I was facing. For minor discrepencies, I would ask my fellow CS 290 friends for help on understanding concepts. </p>

        <h2>Assignment #2: Tweeter: CSS</h2>
        <p><a href = "tweeter.html">View Assignment #2</a></p>
        <p><i>Entry Date: 4-26-20</i></p>
        <p><b>What challenges or troubles did you have completing the assignment? How did you solve them?</b></p>
        <p>The biggest challenges I had were when I tried to change a specific element's properties, but I was actually affecting the element's parent instead. I solved this by slowly working through the DOM model and figuring out which elements I actually needed to affect.</p>
        <p><b>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</b></p>
        <p>While I had a little bit of prior CSS knowledge (and this assignment was definetly a great refresher, this assignment really taught me how to effectively use the inspect element browser tools to become a better web developer.</p>
        <p><b>What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use those resources?</b></p>
		<p>Aside from looking at Piazza and the internet for any problems I had, my primary most helpful resource was working with other people who were dealing with the same issue and figuring out the problems with them. </p>

        <h2>Assignment #2: Tweeter: JS Client-Side</h2>
        <p><a href = "tweeter.html">View Assignment #3</a></p>
        <p><i>Entry Date: 5-11-20</i></p>
        <p><b>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</b></p>
        <p>The biggest challenges I faced were working with various new types of code, so figuring out how everything works was quite difficult. I solved these problems by looking through my notes and understanding how the teacher completed similar problems.</p>
        <p><b>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</b></p>
        <p>Most notibly, I learned how to use JavaScript to manipulate the HTML DOM itself; this particular connection was what I was most excited for going into this assignment. I had worked on JavaScript in the past, but hadn't gotten more complex than creating a few functions.</p>
        <p><b>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</b></p>
        <p>Quite honestly, the most useful resource were my friends. Working together helps tackle issues that sometimes you cannot see on your own. For instance, I was stuck trying to figure out why my 'getElementsByClassName' wasn't working, and my friend noticed that I hadn't included an index. Without him, I may have spent countless minutes trying to figure it out!</p>
        <p><b>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</b></p>
        <p>There were a few coding elements I needed to google. Specifically how to use 'toUpperCase', which I implemented incorrectly within my program the first time around.</p>
